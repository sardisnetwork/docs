The horizontal scaling paradigm will extend to user accounts as well, with each user account supporting their own micro blockchain that finalize payments in real time. Instead of writing each transaction on the main chain ledgers, the stable coin ledger will only account for the current balance information of the user accounts as reported by their micro chains.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"stable/Sardis Stablecoins":{"id":"stable/Sardis Stablecoins","title":"Sardis Stablecoins","description":"Based on newest, yet battleground tested blockchain technology intensely built for speed, the dedicated Sardis stable-coin blockchains will be created for each major FIAT currency-pegged stablecoin.

This will provide unlimited horizontal scaling, supporting potentially millions of transactions each second. Each wallet account on these stablecoin blockchains will have it\u2019s own private ledger-blockchain.
