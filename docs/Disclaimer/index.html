THEY AFFECT YOUR AND OUR RIGHTS CONCERNING THE RESOLUTION OF ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND US.</p><p>Governing Law</p><p>These Terms of Use and performance by you and us hereunder shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware  and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict-of-laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.</p><p>Agreement to Arbitrate</p><p>You and we agree that the sole and exclusive forum and remedy for a Dispute shall be final and binding arbitration pursuant to this section entitled “Dispute Resolution” unless you opt out as provided below. “Dispute” shall include any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use and/or the activities or relationships that involve, lead to, or result from these Terms, including our marketing activities, and (except to the extent provided otherwise in the paragraph entitled “No Class Actions”) the validity or enforceability of this Dispute Resolution section, any part thereof, or the entire Terms of Use.</p><p>Exceptions to Arbitration</p><p>The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; (c) any claim for injunctive relief; and (d) any Dispute that may be brought in small claims court.</p><p>Opt Out of Arbitration</p><p>You may opt out of the binding arbitration described in this section by sending us written notice of your desire to do so by email at <a href="mailto:info@mysardis.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">info@mysardis.com</a> (such notice, an “Arbitration Opt-out Notice”) within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to these Terms of Use, or within thirty (30) days of the date we modify this Dispute Resolution section as indicated in the “Last updated” date above or in the date of our email to you notifying you of such change. If you don’t provide us with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the relevant thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth in the “Exceptions to Arbitration” provision above.</p><p>Arbitration Rules</p><p>The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Dispute Resolution section. All Disputes will be arbitrated before a single arbitrator experienced in the software industry who is jointly selected and mutually approved by you and us or, if you and we are unable to or fail to agree on the selection of the arbitrator within fifteen (15) days of the demand for arbitration being served, who is appointed by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS)</p><p>in accordance with its rules. The arbitration will be administered by JAMS pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (and in accordance with the expedited procedures in those rules) (the “JAMS Rules”), except as modified by this Dispute Resolution section. In the event of a conflict between the JAMS Rules and this Dispute Resolution section, this Dispute Resolution section shall control, subject to countervailing law, unless the Parties agree otherwise. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitations of Liability” section below as to the types and amounts of damages for which a Party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. The JAMS Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available from JAMS at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.jamsadr.com</a> or 1-800-352-5267.</p><p>Arbitration Location and Procedure</p><p>Unless you and we otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and we submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. The results of the arbitration procedure will be considered confidential information of you and us. Any arbitration decision rendered will be final and binding, and judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p>Arbitration Fees</p><p>If we elect arbitration, we shall pay all JAMS filing costs and administrative fees (other than hearing fees). If you elect arbitration, filing costs and administrative fees (other than hearing fees) shall be paid in accordance with the JAMS Rules, or in accordance with countervailing law if contrary to the JAMS Rules. However, if the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, we will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). In such circumstances, fees will be determined in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Each party shall bear the expense of its own attorneys&#x27; fees, except as otherwise provided by law. If a statute gives you the right to recover any of these fees, these statutory rights shall apply in the arbitration notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein.</p><p>No Class Actions</p><p>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, (A) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER PROCEEDING; (B) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; AND (C) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE</p><p>GENERAL PUBLIC OR ANY OTHER PERSONS. Unless consented to in writing by all parties to the arbitration, an award in arbitration shall determine the rights and obligations of such parties only, and only with respect to the claims in arbitration, and shall not (a) determine the rights, obligations, or interests of anyone other than all parties to the arbitration, or resolve any Dispute of anyone other than any such party; nor (b) make an award for the benefit of, or against, anyone other than any such party. No administrator arbitrator shall have the power or authority to waive,</p><p>modify, or fail to enforce this specific paragraph, and any attempt to do so, whether by rule, policy, arbitration decision or otherwise, shall be invalid and unenforceable. If this specific paragraph (“No Class Actions”) is held unenforceable in its entirety, then the entire Dispute Resolution section will be deemed void.</p><p>JUDICIAL FORUM FOR DISPUTES</p><p>In the event that a Dispute falls within one of the abovementioned exceptions to arbitration or if the Dispute Resolution section is found not to apply, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any Dispute will be the state and federal courts located in Delaware and each of the Parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. You and we both further agree to waive our right to a jury trial.</p><p>CORRECTIONS</p><p>There may be information on the Site that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions, including descriptions, pricing, availability, and various other information.
