You will receive the corresponding amount of SRDX coins in accordance with the current price point of your asset at the time of the transaction.<br>
1 SRDX = 1 USD<br>

IMPORTANT! : You might have to wait for some minutes as legacy networks such as Ethereum and BNB take considerable amount of time to confirm transactions, please be patient.

Note 1: You will not be able to use the Sardis Bridge without first having completed the KYC process and registered your Sardis Wallet address.<br>

Note 2: SRDX coins can only used inside the Sardis network to stake, become a validator or DEX usage.
